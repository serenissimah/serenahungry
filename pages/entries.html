                    <p>Here we go! First day of learning web development? Not really, it goes all the way back from high school, trying to learn online in the last year but lately (I mean it has been a couple months), I have been unmotivated. So I am creating this blog/journal (I have more ideas as well for this project) to put in practice what I learn, vent my frustrations in learning something new, and log my progress as well!!!</p>
                    <p>The blog name is a joke between all the people who actually know me in real life. I am constantly hungry and literally eat lunch thinking about dinner. I also am so hungry for knowledge and a challenging life! </p>
                    
                    <p>My first step was to set up a domain, have a hosting service and I still need to figure it out how to publish my code. This last step will be tacled tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday I didn't have much time, I bought some groceries, was prepping and cooking for the week. Setting up a website from scrath is more work than we think and lately I have been feeling so tired. Probably because of my kidneys giving me headaches. I still need to upload some of the code to the website and figure it out which path I am going to take. Writing code and styling some of the things as well. Just a reminder, this is an on-going project. Be patient with my progress because I have a full time job and full life of responsabilities and tasks (like everyone else lol) </p>
